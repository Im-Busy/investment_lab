# Repo Sync — Private → Public Curation

Syncs the `public` branch with the latest `main` changes, automatically stripping private data (market data, ML models, outputs, experiments, reports, notebooks, logs).

## Usage

```
/repo-sync              # Full sync: merge main → public → push
/repo-sync check        # Safety check only: verify no private files on public branch
/repo-sync status       # Show current branch state and remote config
```

## What It Does

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1. Verify | Confirm `origin`→private, `public`→public remotes |
| 2. Pull | Fetch latest `main` from private remote |
| 3. Merge | Merge `main` into `public` branch |
| 4. Safety check | Scan for leaked data/models/outputs/etc |
| 5. Clean | If leak detected: `git rm --cached` private files |
| 6. Push | Push clean `public` branch to public repo |
| 7. Return | Switch back to `main` |

## Safety Guarantees

- Only pushes the `public` branch — never `main`
- Detects and strips: `data/`, `models/`, `outputs/`, `experiments/`, `reports/`, `notebooks/`, `logs/`, `mlflow.db`, `.vscode/`, `.roo/`, `.kilocode/`, archived scripts, egg-info
- Verifies no `main` branch exists on the public remote after push
- All operations are revertible (no destructive commands)

## Emergency

If private files ever appear on the public repo:
```bash
git push public --delete main 2>$null   # Delete main if it exists
git push public --force public           # Force-push clean public branch
```
