                                            travel time). In addition, it is difficult to recruit large numbers of autistic adults due to difficul-

                                         of subjects is thus not feasible with the resources available for early stage work. However, there
                                                    is still a critical need for robust and reliable machine learning (ML) methods using these
                                        smaller datasets.
                                   High dimensional data with small number of samples are particularly common in neuroim-
                                      aging studies. Arbabshirani et al. [3] conducted a survey of neuroimaging studies which used
                                       supervised ML methods to classify healthy individuals and individuals with brain disorders.
                                Most of the surveyed studies had a small number of subjects (median 88) and interestingly, the
                                           overall reported accuracy was higher in the studies with smaller sample sizes. This effect was
                                       evident in the studies focusing on different brain disorders: schizophrenia, mild cognitive

                                   measures of this relationship. Varoquaux [4] also performed a meta-analysis of neuroimaging

                                      higher prediction accuracy reported in the studies with small sample sizes.

                                        pattern recognition [1, 5, 6], only a limited number of papers have systematically investigated

                                    used a fixed sample size dataset (40 samples), and investigated the change from theoretical

                                    performance]” [7]. In comparison, Combrisson and Jerbi [5] used only a K-fold CV approach
                                 and varied sample size. They found that with small sample sizes empirical accuracies overshot
                                           theoretical chance level and were more variable.
                                             Overall, Varma and Simon [7] investigated the choice of validation method, at one fixed

                                      ing different validation methods and systematically varying sample size. In addition, we extend
                                       the synthetic Gaussian noise data classification approach to investigate a number of additional
                                           factors influencing result reliability. Generally, the higher the ratio of features to sample size
                                       the more likely that an ML model will fit the noise in the data instead of underlying pattern [1,
                                               6, 8]. Similarly, the higher the number of adjustable parameters the more likely the ML model
                                                    is to overfit the data [9]. We quantify the effect of this by varying the feature-to-sample ratio
                                 and number of adjustable parameters in the models, as part of our synthetic data classification.

                                  The reminder of this paper is organised as follows. First, we present a new literature review
                                             illustrating the small sample size problem. Previous reviews [3, 4] have demonstrated a nega-
                                             tive relationship between sample size and reported classification accuracy. To show this is an

                                         research, which is relatively nascent field (with only 55 studies identified for inclusion in our
                                         review). We then introduce the different validation methods in section Validation strategies.
                              Our analysis methods are given in section Methods. We have used five clearly defined valida-
                                        tion approaches and systematically varied sample size. We investigated classification of both
                                    Gaussian noise with an expected classification accuracy of 50% (random guessing level) and
                                  randomly generated discriminable data.
                                        In the Results section we show that while certain validation methods produce significantly
                                        overoptimistic performance estimates (> 50%), especially when sample size is small, others are
                                      robust regardless of sample size. We also show that the feature selection process, if performed
                               on pooled training and testing data, is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter
                                        tuning. Results for other factors apart from sample size influencing overfitting and results on
                                           different validation approaches with discriminable data are also included. After the results sec-
                                        tion we have graphically illustrated why models, developed on pooled training and testing
                                           data, can produce overoptimistic performance estimates. The same concepts as in our main
                                       simulations are exemplified in a simpler and more intuitive way, as we are aware that some
                                       readers may be less familiar with ML. Program code used for the main simulations performed
                                        in this study is provided with this article in S1 File.


                        Machine learning in Autism

                             To investigate the state of the art of ML in Autism research, and whether there is an effect of
                                   sample size on reported ML performance, a literature search was performed using search
                                    terms “Autism” AND “Machine learning”, detailed in Table 1. The search time period was: no
                                              start date—18 04 2019 and no search filters were used. Only studies which used ML to predict
                                 two classes and reported accuracy as a performance measure were included to ensure clear
                                         interpretation of the results. In total 55 studies were retained, with the results summarised in

                                  Most of the surveyed studies had a small number of subjects (median 80). The studies used
                                       various types of data to classify autistic and non-autistic individuals, with the majority from
                                       the brain imaging domain. Other studies used, microarray, clinical chemistry, cognitive,
                                 motion and eye tracking data. Studies also used different data pre-processing, feature selection

                                                                            Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size



                                     because of high proportion of small sample studies. We have applied log10 transformation to
                                   sample size data to resolve this issue. After the transformation, the data was normally distrib-
                                         uted, D(55) = 0.12, p = 0.06, and we found a strong negative relationship between log10 trans-
                                  formed sample size and reported accuracy, r(53) = −0.70, p < 0.001. By not transforming the
                                       data and using non-parametric Spearman’s rank-order correlation we found a correlation of a
                                          similar magnitude, r(53) = −0.67, p < 0.001, but we chose to transform sample size data for
                                           clearer graphical representation in Fig 1. Forty nine percent (R2 = 0.49) of variance in reported
                                      accuracy was simply explained by the sample size. Examining the relationship between
                                      reported accuracy and log10 transformed sample size by year a consistent negative relationship
                                 was evident, Fig 1C.
                         We have also performed additional analyses to exclude the possibility that the negative rela-
                                        tionship between sample size and reported accuracy was dependent on the data modality. The
                                      survey was dominated by brain imaging studies and only one other modality of motion track-
                                      ing contained more than two studies allowing separate correlation analyses. We have com-
                                    bined the rest of the studies into a category: other. The results show that a negative relationship
                                   between sample size and reported accuracy was evident in different modalities, Fig 1D. The
                                         correlation between log10 transformed sample size and reported accuracy was r(39) = −0.64,
                                  p < 0.001, for brain imaging studies, r(3) = −0.61, p < 0.271 for motion tracking studies, and
                                           r(7) = −0.90, p = 0.001 for other studies, suggesting that the negative relationship between sam-
                                         ple size and reported accuracy was independent of the study modality.
                          A strong relationship between sample size and reported performance suggests that ML
                                  models are biased to produce overoptimistic results when a sample used to train them is small
                                       Fig 1. In supervised learning, the ideal model would both approximate the regularities in the
                                         training data, and would generalise to unseen new data. However, this is unlikely because
                                         training data may include noise and may not represent the population sufficiently well. Too
                                  complex models are likely to represent noise in the training data, rather than underlying pat-
                                         terns of interest. Such models overfit the training data. In contrast, too simple models are likely
                                         to underfit training data and fail to capture underlying regularities. Obviously, one would aim
                                         to construct a model which fits training data just enough to capture a pattern which is repre-
                                          sentative of the population, but does not fit the noise inherent in the available training data.
                                       Underfitting is improved by simply applying models of increasing complexity, however, over-
                                                 fitting, is a more difficult problem. To assess and control overfitting, model validation is com-
                                monly used.


                             Validation strategies

                        A reliable way to validate a ML model’s performance is to train a model with available data
                                 and assess its classification performance using newly collected data or a separate dataset.
                                  Another reliable approach, commonly called Train/Test Split, is to separate a portion of data
                                       before developing a ML model and to use that data only for validation, Fig 2A. Using unseen
                                       data to test a ML model gives an unbiased estimate of what performance would be when the
                                model is deployed for actual predictions in real-world situations. However, these approaches
                                        require one to collect or hold a substantial amount of data for validation, and are rarely used in
                                       research involving human participants, where data collection is commonly associated with
                                     high costs.
                                         Cross-Validation is a common solution when the available datasets are limited. Instead of
                                         training a fixed model only once as in Train/Test split, iteratively several models are developed
                               on different portions of the data. K-Fold is a common CV approach. First, a well-defined
                                model is developed by normalising data, selecting features, tuning parameters and/or

                                    performing other development steps. Then a portion of data is separated for validation leaving
                                       the rest to train a model and predict the classes on the left-out validation data. This process is
                                      repeated several times, by leaving out a different portion of the data for validation until all the
                                       data is used. The model’s performance is then calculated as a mean of classification perfor-
                                    mances, in each of the validation folds, Fig 2B.
                             When validation with a separate dataset is not feasible because of small sample size, K-Fold
                        CV is very economical as it allows one to use all the data for training and also to reuse all of it
                                          for validation. If validation was to be performed with a separate dataset, double the amount of
                                       data would be needed to have the same quantity of data for training and validation. More
                                      importantly CV theoretically should give more accurate out of sample error estimation, com-
                                    pared to previously discussed approaches. Using all of the available data for validation should

                                                                            Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size



                                         give out of sample error estimates which are less influenced by noise and are more representa-
                                             tive of the population, compared to using a portion of the data as with Train/Test Split or new
                                            dataset.
                                     However, K-Fold CV does not ensure that the data used to validate the classifier is not part
                                         of the data used to train it. Stone [10] pointed out the importance of separating CV used for
                                model development and CV used for model evaluation. Varma and Simon [7] have demon-
                                          strated that using the data to validate a model which was also used to develop it can produce
                                        overoptimistic performance estimates.
                              One possible solution which avoids pooling training and validation data, but at the same
                                    time is economical (allows all the data to be used for training and reuse for validation) is
                                   Nested CV [7, 11], Fig 2C. A portion of data is split at the beginning and in each CV fold
                                      a model is then developed on the reduced training set from scratch, including feature selec-
                                        tion and parameter tuning. This is repeated with splitting a different portion of the data for
                                          validation, and each time developing a new model for training until all the data is used.
                             Varma and Simon [7] suggest that Nested CV provides almost unbiased performance
                                         estimates.

                       Methods

                                     In this study, by using Gaussian noise as data, we have simulated a situation in which robust
                                         validation should produce two-class classification accuracy approaching theoretical chance
                                              level of 50%. We tested five validation approaches: Train/Test Split, K-fold, Nested, and two
                                        types of partially nested CV. Importantly, we performed these simulations using different sam-
                                         ple sizes to provide an insight into whether the tendency to report higher performance esti-
                                   mates with smaller sample size could be due to insufficiently reliable validation. In addition,
                              we have tested what other factors, apart from sample size, influence overfitting and how differ-
                                       ent validation methods perform with discriminable data. To show that simulation results gen-
                                             eralise to algorithms differing in complexity, two algorithms were used. One, computationally
                                demanding and complex, where Support Vector Machine (SVM) [12] classifier with Radial
                                         Basis Function (RBF) kernel was coupled with Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature
                                      Elimination (SVM-RFE) [13] feature selection. Another, simpler, where the logistic regression
                                                classifier was coupled with two-sample t-test feature selection.

                            Overview of procedures

                                          Typically, ML algorithm development starts with data cleaning and outlier removal, then the
                                       data is normalised to ensure that separate features have a balanced influence on the labels.
                               Then if number of features is large, which is especially true for neuroimaging and gene expres-
                                       sion studies [3, 14, 15], feature selection is performed. This is done because ML algorithms
                                    tend to achieve optimal performance in a reduced feature space [6, 16]. Many of the ML mod-
                                                els include hyper-parameters which can be fine-tuned. This process is commonly coupled with
                        CV to not only achieve optimal algorithm performance, but also to control overfitting. Finally,
                                       the model is validated to ensure that it generalises to “unseen” data. Below the development
                                          stages of ML algorithms which were used in this study are described with a particular emphasis
                               on validation.

                           Data

                                  Data was simulated by randomly drawing values from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of
                                      zero and standard deviation (SD) of one. Numpy (Python) method random.normal was used
                                         to generate pseudo-random values drawn from standard normal distribution. Binomial

                                                                            Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size



                                             classification was used, and each simulated dataset was split into two equally sized subsets for
                                    each class. Because features did not bear meaningful relationship to labels, and classes were
                                       balanced, binomial classification models would be expected to yield chance level classification
                                      accuracy of 50%.


                           Data normalisation, cleaning

                               As the data was drawn from standard normal distribution data normalisation was not neces-
                                        sary and was omitted. Data cleaning was also not necessary in this case; however, with real
                                            datasets, missing value replacement/removal and outlier replacement/removal are usually nec-
                                         essary steps.


                                  Classification algorithms

                                   For classification, SVM [12] was chosen because it was by far most commonly used algorithm
                                        in our survey, Fig 1B. We have also used a logistic regression algorithm.
                          SVM separates the classes by maximising the gap between training examples from each
                                                class. The examples in the test data are when assigned a label based on which side of the gap
                                      they fall. The SVM algorithm assumes linear separability of classes, however in reality this
                                   assumption in rarely realistic. Therefore, a regularisation parameter C is introduced which
                                    weighs the importance of misclassification and allows SVM to fit a linear separating hyper-
                                      plane with some of the examples being misclassified. Another method to deal with non-line-
                                            arly separable classes is to use kernel functions. Kernel functions project features to a higher
                                    dimensional space. This enables the separation of classes which are non-linearly separable in
                                       the original space with a linear hyperplane in a higher dimensional space. In this study SVM
                                     with RBF kernel was used. RBF kernel has a regularisation parameter γ, which regulates the
                                     spread of the kernel function and in turn determines the flexibility of the separating hyper-
                                         plane. SVM was implemented with Libsvm library [17].
                           A logistic regression model was also used as a classifier. It uses logistic function to predict
                                      binary classes based on linear combinations between class and features. Logistic regression
                                 was implemented using Scikit-learn library [18].


                            Parameter tuning of classification algorithms
                            SVM-RBF regularization parameters C and γ were optimized to improve classification and to
                                        control overfitting. Both parameters regulate the complexity of a separating hyperplane. By set-
                                          ting a low penalty for misclassification (parameter C) SVM tries to classify all training exam-
                                          ples correctly making a separating boundary complex. Similarly, the higher the value of
                                           kernel’s γ parameter, the more flexible and complex the separating boundary. To optimise C
                                 and γ parameters we used a grid search approach, which evaluates classification accuracy with
                                           different combinations of C and γ parameters by using 10-fold CV. A pairing of C and γ
                                     parameters which gave the highest CV accuracy was selected. Grid search was performed with
                                     parameters set to: C = 2j, where j = 1, 2, . . . 7 and γ = 2i, where i = -1, -2, . . . -7. Grid search
                                 was implemented with Scikit-learn library. For visualisation of how parameters influence SVM
                                       decision boundary see Devos et al. [19]
                               To control for overfitting logistic regression was regularised using L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge)
                                       penalty terms and the magnitude of penalty was controlled by regularization parameter C.
                                      Like in SVM, smaller values of C specify stronger regularization. To optimize parameters grid
                                       search was performed with penalty set to L1 or L2 and C set to C = ei, where i = 0, 1, . . . 9.

                                                                            Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size


                              Feature selection

                                Most of the studies in our own and other surveys [3, 4] used feature selection. Therefore, for
                                   our simulations we initially generated 50 features comprised of Gaussian noise and used fea-
                                        ture selection to reduce dimensionality. We chose two feature selection methods, one compu-
                                            tationally complex—SVM-RFE, and another simpler—two-sample t-test.
                               SVM-RFE algorithm selects features based on how important they are for an SVM classifier
                                         to separate classes. SVM-RFE starts with a full feature set and in a number of iterations elimi-
                                        nates a set number of features which are deemed least important for separating classes by an
                        SVM algorithm, using weight vector of dimension length(s) as a ranking criterion [13]. The
                                      algorithm removes least important features in iterations because in each iteration the relation-
                                       ship between features and labels changes. Top-ranked features are not necessarily the most rel-
                                      evant individually; they are, however, optimized by considering interdependencies with other
                                          features and the class. The final feature set is selected from the iteration in which SVM achieves
                                         best classification performance. In this study a single feature was eliminated in each SVM-RFE
                                           iteration and the final feature set was selected based on the highest classification accuracy by
                                           linear SVM with C set to 1.
                                     Two-sample t-test was also used for feature selection. In contrast to SVM-RFE it is a much
                                      simpler method which ranks features based on how different feature means are between the
                                 two classes. In this study, 10 features with the highest absolute value of t statistic were selected.

                               Validation and performance evaluation

                                   For validation of the results, five different validation approaches were used and their perfor-
                               mance was compared.
                                          Train/Test Split is a simple and reliable validation approach. A portion of the data was split
                                       before any model development steps and it was used only once to validate the developed
                                model Fig 2A.
                                       K-Fold CV. First, a single well-defined model was developed by selecting features and tun-
                                      ing parameters, Fig 2B. Then the model was validated by separating one-tenth of the data for
                                         validation and the rest for training. CV process was iteratively repeated ten times. In each fold,
                                      a different one-tenth of the data was selected for validation. In such way, in the end, all the
                                       data was used for training and also for validation. The final performance of the model was
                                    then calculated as a mean of classification performances in each of the ten validation folds.
                                        Nested CV is performed in two layers to achieve training and validation separation, Fig 2C.
                                     In this study, ten-fold Nested CV was used. In the outer layer, 10% of the data was separated
                                          for validation and the rest of the data was used to develop a model. In the internal layer, the
                                    remaining 90% of the data was used for feature selection and parameter tuning. A developed
                                model was then validated with 10% of the data which was split at the beginning. This process
                                 was repeated 10 times by selecting a different 10% of the data for validation and by using a dif-
                                          ferent 90% of the data to develop a new model from scratch. The overall performance was then
                                         calculated as a mean of classification performances of the 10 separately developed models on
                                           different 10% sets of the validation data which was not involved in developing the models.
                                               Partially nested validation. Arbabshirani et al [3] in their large survey noted that in most
                                            studies, feature selection was performed in a non-nested fashion. Feature extraction/selection
                                   can be computationally very demanding which could explain why it is frequently performed
                                     only once on pooled training and testing data, instead of performing it in each CV fold. In this
                                         study, to examine whether accuracy estimates are biased more by feature selection or parame-
                                             ter tuning we performed two types of partially nested validation, Fig 2D. First, feature selection
                                 was performed in a non-nested fashion and parameter tuning in nested fashion. That is,

                                          feature selection was performed once in an outer nested validation loop, on pooled training
                                 and validation data. Only parameter tuning was nested and performed 10 times, avoiding the
                                      pooling of training and validation data. Second, feature selection was performed in nested and
                                    parameter tuning in a non-nested fashion.

                            Implementation

                               The results section is organised as follows. First, we compare five different validation methods
                                      using Gaussian noise data as features. Data was split into two equally sized subsets for each
                                                class. The feature set started with 50 features and was reduced by using feature selection. Sam-
                                         ple size was manipulated, and classification results were evaluated using Train/Test Split, K-
                                          fold CV, Nested CV and two types of partially nested CV. The performance estimate was accu-
                                           racy. To obtain accuracy distributions models were trained 50 times at each sample point, then
                                         validation results were compared against theoretical chance level using confidence level of
                                  95%.
                                      Then, other factors apart from sample size which can lead to overfitting with K-fold CV
                                  were investigated. We kept sample size constant, but manipulated number of Gaussian noise
                                            features. As feature-to-sample ratio is well known to influence classification result reliability
                                       [20–22], we additionally manipulated feature-to-sample ratio from 1/3 to 3 and show that fea-
                                      ture/sample size ratio can be a good indicator of how much a model is likely to overfit. We also
                                         investigated how overfitting was influenced by grid size used to fine-tune classifier hyper-
                                     parameters and number of CV folds.
                                                Finally, different validation methods were compared by using discriminable data to investi-
                                        gate an interaction between the increase in classification ability [23–25] and the reduction in
                                           overfitting with larger samples. Discriminable datasets were generated with 50 features and
                                     balanced labels. 40 of the features were generated from zero-mean and one SD Gaussian noise
                                          for both classes. To create discriminability, the remaining 10 features for the first class were
                                      generated from Gaussian noise with a mean of 0.5 and SD of one while for the second class
                                 from the Gaussian noise with a mean of 0 and SD of one.
                                       Unless indicated differently all model parameters were set as described in this section.

                           Results

                          Comparison of different validation methods

                               The effect of sample size on how close the empirical classification result is to theoretical chance
                                              level was examined. The sample size was manipulated and ranged from 20 to 1000. To evaluate
                                             classification results K-Fold, Nested, Train/Test Split and two types of partially nested valida-
                                        tion were used. Fig 3 shows that by using both a complex algorithm, where SVM-RFE feature
                                          selection was coupled with a SVM-RBF classifier (SVM algorithm hereafter, Fig 3A), and a
                                      simpler algorithm, with t-test feature selection and a logistic regression classifier (logistic
                                        regression algorithm hereafter, Fig 3B), accuracies given by K-Fold CV were considerably
                                      higher than the theoretical chance level of 50%. The highest difference was observed with
                                        smaller sample sizes; however, the difference was still evident even at the sample size of
                       N = 1000. In contrast accuracy distributions produced by using Nested CV and Train/Test
                                             Split did not statistically significantly differ from 50% chance level with SVM and logistic
                                        regression algorithms at 96.5% sample size points (p ranged from 4.3 × 10−4 to 0.997, a small
                               number of significant differences is expected by chance with 95% confidence level).
                             Two types of partially nested validation were also performed. In the first instance, only
                                    parameter tuning was nested while feature selection was performed on the pooled training and
                                           testing data in non-nested fashion. Fig 3 shows that nesting parameter tuning only was not

                                            sufficient to control overfitting. By using both SVM and logistic regression algorithms, empiri-
                                            cal accuracies at each sample point were significantly higher than the 50% chance level (p ran-
                                   ged from 1.1 × 10−42 to 6.3 × 10−20 and from 1.7 × 10−33 to 1.7 × 10−22 respectively). The
                                            results were considerably different when feature selection was nested and only parameter tun-
                                      ing was performed on the pooled training and testing data. The curves approached 50% chance
                                                 level, Fig 3. One sample t-tests showed that for the SVM algorithm empirical accuracy distribu-
                                         tions were significantly higher than 50% chance level on 56% sample size points (p ranged
                                 from 2.8 × 10−5 to 0.879). For a logistic regression algorithm accuracy distribution using this
                                       type of partially nested validation was higher than the chance level only at one sample size
                                      point (2%, p ranged from 0.039 to 1.0).
                                   Taken together, partially nested validation results show that to perform feature selection in
                                      nested fashion is paramount for controlling overfitting, while nesting parameter tuning has a
                                        smaller effect. This was the case for our data and models used. However, for other situations,
                                             especially, if feature selection is not used or relied less, parameter tuning could contribute to
                                           overfitting more. Our models relied on feature selection substantially, reducing feature num-
                                      ber from 50 to 10, to represent ML studies for disorder prediction, which commonly use fea-
                                        ture selection as an important model development step [3, 26].


                           Other factors apart from sample size influencing overfitting

                                   Other factors influencing overfitting with K-Fold CV were examined. Sample size was kept
                                      constant at N = 100 while feature number, parameter tuning grid size and number of CV folds
                                  were manipulated. Both SVM-RFE and t-test feature selection were used in combination with
                            SVM-RBF classifier (Fig 4) and logistic regression classifier (Fig 5).
                              Number of features.  For both SVM (Fig 4A) and logistic regression (Fig 5A) classifiers
                                          feature number had a clear influence on overfitting. The higher the number of features used,
                                       the greater the difference was between the empirical classification accuracy and theoretical
                                   chance level of 50%. There was also a clear difference between the feature selectors used.
                            SVM-RFE accuracies were higher than t-test, and this difference became greater with increas-
                                      ing feature space to select from.

                                             Classifier hyper-parameter optimisation.  Grid size used to fine-tune SVM-RBF C and γ
                                     parameters also had a clear influence on overfitting, as grid size increased, achieved accuracies
                                          also increased (Fig 4B). There was, however, no such effect on accuracy when the grid size to
                                        fine-tune logistic regression parameters was increased (Fig 5B).
                              Number of CV folds.  Similar results were observed when the number of CV folds used to
                                        fine-tune the model’s hyper-parameters was increased. With SVM-RBF classifier, the use of a
                                      higher number of folds affected accuracy up to approximately 20 folds when the effect levelled
                                                  off. There was again no clear effect when the number of CV folds was increased with the logis-
                                                  tic regression classifier.


                              Feature-to-sample ratio

                               The results on other factors influencing overfitting showed that the number of features used to
                                     develop a model had a clear impact on overfitting regardless of the feature selector or classifier
                                        used. This effect was investigated further as it is likely that feature-to-sample ratio could be a
                                          better indicator of how much a model is likely to overfit compared to sample size alone. Sam-
                                         ple size was manipulated from 42 to 446 and feature number was also manipulated accord-
                                             ingly, to achieve different feature-to-sample ratios of 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 10 and 20, Fig 6. The

                                            results showed that feature-to-sample ratio is a good indicator of how much a model is likely
                                              overfit. By using both SVM (Fig 6A) and logistic regression (Fig 6B) algorithms the accuracies
                                      achieved by models with higher feature-to-sample ratios were greater.

                               Validation with discriminable data

                             To make data discriminable, 10 out of 50 features were generated from Gaussian noise with
                                means differing between classes (see section Implementation). SVM-RFE was used for feature
                                          selection and SVM-RBF for classification. Models were validated using different validation
                                    methods: K-Fold CV, Nested CV and Train/Test Split. Fig 7A shows that performance esti-
                                   mates were varied. There were no significant differences in accuracy between Train/Test Split
                                         validation and Nested CV at 96% of sample size points, two-sample t-test (p ranged from 0.039
                                         to 0.995). K-fold CV however gave significantly higher performance estimates compared to
                                    Nested CV (p ranged from 1.3 × 10−6 to 5.4 × 10−35) or Train/Test Split validation (p ranged
                                 from 3.8 × 10−1 to 5.3 × 10−19). The accuracy for both Train/Test split and Nested CV
                                       increased with sample size and then levelled off when sample size reached approximately
                       N = 700 at  77% accuracy level. This shows a well-known aspect of ML models; with a larger
                                         training sample size, models have higher statistical power to learn a pattern discriminating
                                   between classes and achieve higher performance. Several studies have explored this by calculat-
                                      ing learning curves which show accuracy as a function of the training sample size [23–25] and
                                  assume a typical shape similar to Nested CV or Train/Test Split curves in Fig 7A. The K-fold
                        CV curve, on the other hand, was not of the typical learning curve shape. Although an increase
                                        in learning must have been present with larger sample sizes, the overfitting had a stronger
                                                effect. This was further shown by exploring variability of performance estimates expressed as
                             95% confidence intervals, Fig 7B. Similarly, as in [4, 5] we found that with larger sample sizes
                                             variability in performance estimates decreased. This was not the case for K-fold validation
                                  where variability increased up to N   60 and then started decreasing, Fig 7B inset. This
                                 was caused by a high frequency of perfect classification (100%) occurrences at sample sizes
                                   below 60.

                                 Illustrative examples of why models overfit

                              Our simulations show that validating models with the data which was also involved in model
                                         training can lead to overfitting and overoptimistic performance estimates. However, it may
                                    not necessarily be intuitive why overfitting occurs. Here we graphically illustrate how two
                                model development stages, parameter tuning and feature selection, can lead to overfitting if
                                       those development stages are performed on the pooled training and validation data. The exam-
                                          ples are small and simple, illustrating the concepts explored in our main simulations in a more
                                            intuitive way.

                            Parameter tuning and overfitting

                             To illustrate how parameter tuning can lead to overfitting we have used a small classification
                                   example with a sample size of 10 (5 samples from one class and 5 samples from a second class)
                                 and only two features. The data was generated from random Gaussian noise and SVM-RBF
                                       (with the same settings as in the main analyses) was used to separate data points from two clas-
                                           ses (shown in red and blue in Fig 8A).
                         We have developed two models in parallel on the same data and with the identical settings.
                             To validate we have used the same two data points for both models. The only difference
                                   between the models was that the first model (Fig 8A left) was trained on all 10 data points—on
                                       the pooled training and validation data. The second model (Fig 8A right) was developed by
                                     keeping training and validation data independent. It was trained on 8 data points making the
                                    remaining 2 validation data points ‘’invisible’’ to the model. Decision boundaries (lines sepa-
                                         rating blue and red areas in Fig 8A) were clearly differently learned by the two models. The
                                                    first model fitted the data which was used for validation and classified two validation data
                                       points correctly, while the second model, for which validation data was ‘invisible’ misclassified
                                       the same two validation data points.
                                  By running these two models 1000 times, each time with different randomly generated
                                           data, both models were capable of fitting training data and achieve over 80% classification
                                        accuracy, showing that the models were capable of fitting random noise well. The first model,

                                    however, also fitted noise in the validation data achieving mean accuracy of 81%, while the sec-
                               ond model for which validation points were ‘invisible’ achieved accuracy rate of 50%, random
                                      guessing level.
                                             Overall, this example graphically illustrates that complex enough models are capable of fit-
                                          ting random noise in the data. It also shows that if the data, which is used for validation, is also
                                      involved in parameter tuning, the performance is inflated because the models fit the noise not
                                     only in training but also in validation data.


                              Feature selection and overfitting

                             To graphically illustrate how performing feature selection on pooled training and validation
                                       data can lead to overfitting we have used t-test feature selection. t statistic of two-sample t-test
                                     simply shows how different are the means between two classes in units of standard error. We
                                    have used Gaussian noise data of 50 samples equally balanced between two classes and per-
                                  formed t-test feature selection to select 10 features from sets varying from 20 to 100 features.
                               20% of the data was randomly split for validation and once again we have performed feature
                                          selection using two different approaches. in the first instance it was performed on the pooled
                                         training and validation data and in the second instance only training data was used for feature
                                            selection. This was repeated 100 times.
                                          Fig 8B shows that with the larger pool of features to select from, the selected ten features
                                 had greater between-class mean differences than with the smaller pool of features to select
                                 from (train lines in Fig 8B). This was the case for both approaches. The main difference
                                   between two approaches was in validation. Selecting 10 features with greatest mean differences
                               on pooled training and validation data (100% of data) also led to greater between-class mean
                                          differences in validation data alone (randomly split 20% of data). The effect also increased with
                                           larger feature pool to select from. This was not the case when validation data was independent
                                         of feature selection. Despite mean differences being high in ten selected features in the training
                                       data (80% of data), the selected features produced low mean differences on validation data
                                (20% of randomly split data) which would be expected by chance.

                                        This example shows that feature selection is capable to select features as discriminative
                                   between classes because of inherent noise (in this example the data was Gaussian noise with
                                   between class differences occurring by chance). It also shows that if feature selection is per-
                                  formed on pooled training and validation data, the validation data can occur discriminative
                                     because of noise.


                          Discussion

                                   Robust evaluation of ML classification is imperative for ML research as it allows meaningful
                                   comparisons between different studies and different methods. Robust evaluation is even more
                                    important when available training and testing samples are small [1, 6].
                                Our results demonstrate the importance of separating training and testing data to avoid
                                           optimistically biased performance estimates. K-Fold CV was not sufficient to control overfit-
                                             ting. By simply testing the performance of the algorithm with the data which was also involved
                                        in algorithm training was enough to produce biased results with small sample sizes. However,
                                      a substantial bias still remained even with sample size of 1000. On the other hand, similar to
                                           [7] we have found that Nested CV gave unbiased performance estimates. Furthermore, Nested
                        CV results were unbiased regardless of the sample size.
                                            Additionally, we examined which model development stage, feature selection or parameter
                                     tuning is implicated in validation bias more. Partially-nested validation results showed that by
                                    performing only feature selection in a non-nested fashion gave considerably biased results,
                                      while the bias was much smaller when only parameter tuning was performed in non-nested
                                          fashion. In many studies, the initial number of measures (features) can be very large. In their
                                      survey Arbabshirani et al. [3] noted that most of the neuroimaging studies consisted of two
                                             parts. In the first part using statistical tests, such as t-tests, differences between groups were
                                            identified. In the second part features, which were preselected in the first part, were used for
                                              classification. As a result, feature selection was performed on the pooled training and testing
                                       data and posed a bias. Although, performing feature selection multiple times in nested fashion
                                     with high dimensional data can be computationally demanding, our simulations have shown
                                          that it is necessary to avoid overfitting. Additionally, other model development stages which
                                  were not examined in this study (e.g. normalisation, outlier removal) if performed on pooled
                                         training and testing data could also lead to biased results.
                         We have also investigated other factors which could influence overfitting when K-Fold CV
                                                    is used. Our results have demonstrated that feature-to-sample ratio is a good indicator of how
                             much a model is likely to overfit. The accuracies achieved by models with higher feature-to-
                                   sample ratios were greater. Increasing the set of parameters over which a model is optimized
                                          also increased amount of bias with SVM model. There was no such effect with logistic regres-
                                           sion. Similarly, greater number of CV folds used for parameter tuning had only a slight effect
                                     with SVM model and no effect with logistic regression model.
                                Our simulations with discriminable data showed that by using Nested CV and Train/Test
                                                 split validation, models were capable of learning a pattern in the data more efficiently and
                                      achieved higher performance with larger sample sizes. This is consistent with previous studies
                                  which investigated accuracy as a function of the training sample size [23–25]. Interestingly, the
                                        distance between K-fold and Nested CV curves with non-discriminable data (Fig 3A) was
                                           larger than with discriminable data (Fig 7A) at each sample size point. This suggests that with
                               more discriminable data bias produced by less robust validation is lower and also the opposite,
                                       the less discriminable the data the higher the importance of robust validation.
                                          Validation results were highly variable as can be seen from 95% confidence intervals
                                      included in each graph. The same algorithm used on the data drawn from the same

                                                                            Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size



                                         distribution produced broad range of performance estimates. The variability of performance
                                        estimates was also greater with smaller sample sizes, Fig 7B. In most studies in our survey, a
                                           single performance estimate was reported. However, as our results indicate and as noted by
                                 Varoquaux [4] intrinsically large sampling noise signifies the importance of reporting confi-
                                   dence intervals. Practically a distribution of performance measures could be produced by, for
                                     example, multiple times differently/randomly splitting the data to CV folds [27].
                                   Only a few previous studies systematically investigated ML validation caveats associated
                                     with small sample size. Arbabshirani et al. [3] and Varoquaux [4] reviewed studies, which
                                       applied ML methods for prediction of various brain disorders and found that studies with
                                        smaller sample sizes tended to report higher classification performance. In this paper, as an
                                               illustrative example we have performed a survey of studies which used ML classification to pre-
                                           dict autism or absence of autism (two class problem) and indeed found a significant negative
                                         relationship between sample size and accuracy, r(53) = −0.70, p < 0.001. Study surveys by
                                     Arbabshirani et al. [3], Varoquaux [4] and our survey, all suggest the importance of robust
                                        application of ML methods. To help in this process, there are good guideline studies advising
                             how to avoid pitfalls, including how to reliably validate the results [28, 29].
                                         Like in our simulations Combrisson and Jerbi [5] used Gaussian noise data to investigate
                             how much empirical classification performance differed from theoretical chance level. Several
                                               classifiers coupled with K-fold CV were used. Empirical accuracies overshot theoretical chance
                                              level and were more variable when sample sizes were small. The researchers interpreted this
                                      discrepancy between theoretical and empirical accuracy level as arising from the fact that small
                                    samples give a bad approximation of true randomness. Our simulations, however, show that
                                             this is not the case. In contrast to Combrisson and Jerbi [5] in our simulation we used not only
                                      K-fold CV but also other validation methods. Nested and Train/Test Split validation results
                                showed no deviation from the theoretical chance level regardless of the sample size and the
                                              effect of bad approximation of true randomness was not present. Overoptimistic performance
                                 was observed only with validation methods in which the validation process pooled training
                                 and testing data.
                               Varma and Simon [7] also used synthetic Gaussian noise data to investigate how far
                                     experimental two-class classification error was from expected 50% theoretical error. The
                                       researchers found that by using K-fold CV mean error was considerably overoptimistic. On
                                       the other hand, Nested CV provided almost unbiased performance estimates. The research-
                                              ers, however did not investigate the influence of sample size, which for all simulations was
                                         fixed at N = 40. We show that not only with N = 40 but even at larger sample sizes of up to
                       N = 1000 K-fold CV bias remains, although it becomes less prominent with larger sample
                                               sizes.
                                    Combrisson and Jerbi [5] have shown that K-fold CV is more biased with small sample
                                                 size, while Varma and Simon [7] have shown that K-fold CV is biased, and Nested CV is not at
                                      a fixed sample size. We have filled the gap by investigating both factors associated with bias,
                                  namely validation method and sample size together. We have demonstrated that validation
                                 methods which do not separate training and testing data at model development stage lead to
                                        overoptimistic performance estimates. Moreover, the bias is strongest with small sample sizes.
                                     This gives a good indication why in our own and other surveys [3, 4] there was a negative rela-
                                        tionship between reported performance estimates and sample size.


                         Conclusion

                        We show that K-Fold CV provides optimistically biased performance estimates and is not suf-
                                              ficient to control overfitting. Testing algorithm performance on the data which was used for

                                                                            Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size



                                         training the same algorithm is enough to produce strongly optimistically biased results when a
                                   sample size is small. However, a substantial bias remains even with respectable sample sizes. In
                                           contrast, Nested CV provides unbiased performance estimates. Completely separating testing
                                 and training data is enough to obtain unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample
                                                 size. When only part of model development is performed in a nested fashion, nesting feature
                                          selection is more important than parameter tuning to avoid overfitting. Other factors which
                                        influence bias, such as data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space, number of CV folds and
                                       data discriminability should also be considered.

                                            travel time). In addition, it is difficult to recruit large numbers of autistic adults due to difficul-

                                         of subjects is thus not feasible with the resources available for early stage work. However, there
                                                    is still a critical need for robust and reliable machine learning (ML) methods using these
                                        smaller datasets.
                                   High dimensional data with small number of samples are particularly common in neuroim-
                                      aging studies. Arbabshirani et al. [3] conducted a survey of neuroimaging studies which used
                                       supervised ML methods to classify healthy individuals and individuals with brain disorders.
                                Most of the surveyed studies had a small number of subjects (median 88) and interestingly, the
                                           overall reported accuracy was higher in the studies with smaller sample sizes. This effect was
                                       evident in the studies focusing on different brain disorders: schizophrenia, mild cognitive

                                   measures of this relationship. Varoquaux [4] also performed a meta-analysis of neuroimaging

                                      higher prediction accuracy reported in the studies with small sample sizes.
                                         Despite small sample sizes being common, and the fact that limited data is problematic for
                                        pattern recognition [1, 5, 6], only a limited number of papers have systematically investigated

                                    used a fixed sample size dataset (40 samples), and investigated the change from theoretical

                                    performance]” [7]. In comparison, Combrisson and Jerbi [5] used only a K-fold CV approach
                                 and varied sample size. They found that with small sample sizes empirical accuracies overshot
                                           theoretical chance level and were more variable.
                                             Overall, Varma and Simon [7] investigated the choice of validation method, at one fixed
                                   sample size, while Combrisson and Jerbi [5] varied sample size, but only with one validation
                                  method. In this paper we build on their work and combine the two approaches, by investigat-
                                      ing different validation methods and systematically varying sample size. In addition, we extend
                                       the synthetic Gaussian noise data classification approach to investigate a number of additional
                                           factors influencing result reliability. Generally, the higher the ratio of features to sample size
                                       the more likely that an ML model will fit the noise in the data instead of underlying pattern [1,
                                               6, 8]. Similarly, the higher the number of adjustable parameters the more likely the ML model
                                                    is to overfit the data [9]. We quantify the effect of this by varying the feature-to-sample ratio
                                 and number of adjustable parameters in the models, as part of our synthetic data classification.

Abstract

Advances in neuroimaging, genomic, motion tracking, eye-tracking and many other technol-
ogy-based data collection methods have led to a torrent of high dimensional datasets, which
commonly have a small number of samples because of the intrinsic high cost of data collec-
tion involving human participants. High dimensional data with a small number of samples is
of critical importance for identifying biomarkers and conducting feasibility and pilot work,
however it can lead to biased machine learning (ML) performance estimates. Our review of
studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that
small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy. Thus, we have
investigated whether this bias could be caused by the use of validation methods which do
not sufficiently control overfitting. Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV)
produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is
still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce
robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that
feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias con-
siderably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data
dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and valida-
tion methods were compared with discriminable data. The results suggest how to design
robust testing methodologies when working with small datasets and how to interpret the
results of other studies based on what validation method was used.

Introduction

Generally, the larger the dataset the greater statistical power for pattern recognition [1]. Large
datasets are also becoming more common, partly because the data is increasingly gathered by
cheap and widely available methods such as Internet of things (IoT) devices. Databases such as
the UK Biobank [2] are aggregating data from more than 500,000 people to enable very large-
scale data analysis, provided that the desired analysis is supported by the data available in the
database.

Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size

Unfortunately, such techniques and large databases are of less use for traditional hypothesis

driven research. Advances in neuroimaging, genomic, motion-tracking, eye-tracking and
many other technology-based data collection methods have led to many datasets, which fre-
quently have a small number of samples. Small samples are common because tasks and experi-
mental protocols which maximally discriminate between different conditions are still under
development and because of the costs associated with data collection involving human partici-
pants. For example, in our work with autistic adults, running an experiment to generate one
sample of high dimensional data may require 1.5–4 hours of experimenter time (for running
the experiment including set up and set down) and 3.5–6 hours of participant time (including
travel time). In addition, it is difficult to recruit large numbers of autistic adults due to difficul-
ties accessing participants and encouraging participation. Collecting samples from thousands
of subjects is thus not feasible with the resources available for early stage work. However, there
is still a critical need for robust and reliable machine learning (ML) methods using these
smaller datasets.

High dimensional data with small number of samples are particularly common in neuroim-

aging studies. Arbabshirani et al. [3] conducted a survey of neuroimaging studies which used
supervised ML methods to classify healthy individuals and individuals with brain disorders.
Most of the surveyed studies had a small number of subjects (median 88) and interestingly, the
overall reported accuracy was higher in the studies with smaller sample sizes. This effect was
evident in the studies focusing on different brain disorders: schizophrenia, mild cognitive
impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, depressive disorders, autism spectrum conditions, and atten-
tion-deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, Arbabshirani et al. [3] did not report statistical
measures of this relationship. Varoquaux [4] also performed a meta-analysis of neuroimaging
review papers which included studies focusing on various brain diseases and classification
methods. Overall, similarly as in Arbabshirani et al. [3] survey, a clear pattern emerged with
higher prediction accuracy reported in the studies with small sample sizes.

Despite small sample sizes being common, and the fact that limited data is problematic for
pattern recognition [1, 5, 6], only a limited number of papers have systematically investigated
how the ML validation process should be designed to help avoid optimistic performance esti-
mates. Previous papers [5, 7] used synthetic Gaussian noise data to investigate how far experi-
mental classification error is from the expected theoretical chance level. Varma and Simon [7]
used a fixed sample size dataset (40 samples), and investigated the change from theoretical
chance performance when using two different Cross-Validation (CV) approaches for selecting
the data used for model development and model validation (Different CV methods are intro-
duced in detail in section Validation strategies). They showed that the nested CV approach
which avoided pooling training and testing data produced an “almost unbiased estimate [of
performance]” [7]. In comparison, Combrisson and Jerbi [5] used only a K-fold CV approach
and varied sample size. They found that with small sample sizes empirical accuracies overshot
theoretical chance level and were more variable.

Overall, Varma and Simon [7] investigated the choice of validation method, at one fixed
sample size, while Combrisson and Jerbi [5] varied sample size, but only with one validation
method. In this paper we build on their work and combine the two approaches, by investigat-
ing different validation methods and systematically varying sample size. In addition, we extend
the synthetic Gaussian noise data classification approach to investigate a number of additional
factors influencing result reliability. Generally, the higher the ratio of features to sample size
the more likely that an ML model will fit the noise in the data instead of underlying pattern [1,
6, 8]. Similarly, the higher the number of adjustable parameters the more likely the ML model
is to overfit the data [9]. We quantify the effect of this by varying the feature-to-sample ratio
and number of adjustable parameters in the models, as part of our synthetic data classification.

Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size

The reminder of this paper is organised as follows. First, we present a new literature review
illustrating the small sample size problem. Previous reviews [3, 4] have demonstrated a nega-
tive relationship between sample size and reported classification accuracy. To show this is an
ongoing issue we have performed a survey of studies which used ML algorithms in autism
research, which is relatively nascent field (with only 55 studies identified for inclusion in our
review). We then introduce the different validation methods in section Validation strategies.
Our analysis methods are given in section Methods. We have used five clearly defined valida-
tion approaches and systematically varied sample size. We investigated classification of both
Gaussian noise with an expected classification accuracy of 50% (random guessing level) and
randomly generated discriminable data.

In the Results section we show that while certain validation methods produce significantly
overoptimistic performance estimates (> 50%), especially when sample size is small, others are
robust regardless of sample size. We also show that the feature selection process, if performed
on pooled training and testing data, is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter
tuning. Results for other factors apart from sample size influencing overfitting and results on
different validation approaches with discriminable data are also included. After the results sec-
tion we have graphically illustrated why models, developed on pooled training and testing
data, can produce overoptimistic performance estimates. The same concepts as in our main
simulations are exemplified in a simpler and more intuitive way, as we are aware that some
readers may be less familiar with ML. Program code used for the main simulations performed
in this study is provided with this article in S1 File.

Machine learning in Autism

To investigate the state of the art of ML in Autism research, and whether there is an effect of
sample size on reported ML performance, a literature search was performed using search
terms “Autism” AND “Machine learning”, detailed in Table 1. The search time period was: no
start date—18 04 2019 and no search filters were used. Only studies which used ML to predict
two classes and reported accuracy as a performance measure were included to ensure clear
interpretation of the results. In total 55 studies were retained, with the results summarised in
Fig 1. Details of the surveyed studies and measures used for analyses as well as full references
are provided in S1 Table.

Most of the surveyed studies had a small number of subjects (median 80). The studies used

various types of data to classify autistic and non-autistic individuals, with the majority from
the brain imaging domain. Other studies used, microarray, clinical chemistry, cognitive,
motion and eye tracking data. Studies also used different data pre-processing, feature selection
and classification methods, Fig 1B. In our survey We explored if even after combining such
varied studies there was a relationship between sample size and accuracy. A Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test indicated that sample size in our surveyed studies did not follow a normal distri-
bution, D(55) = 0.28, p < 0.001. A distribution was strongly positively skewed and leptokurtic

because of high proportion of small sample studies. We have applied log10 transformation to
sample size data to resolve this issue. After the transformation, the data was normally distrib-
uted, D(55) = 0.12, p = 0.06, and we found a strong negative relationship between log10 trans-
formed sample size and reported accuracy, r(53) = −0.70, p < 0.001. By not transforming the
data and using non-parametric Spearman’s rank-order correlation we found a correlation of a
similar magnitude, r(53) = −0.67, p < 0.001, but we chose to transform sample size data for
clearer graphical representation in Fig 1. Forty nine percent (R2 = 0.49) of variance in reported
accuracy was simply explained by the sample size. Examining the relationship between
reported accuracy and log10 transformed sample size by year a consistent negative relationship
was evident, Fig 1C.

We have also performed additional analyses to exclude the possibility that the negative rela-
tionship between sample size and reported accuracy was dependent on the data modality. The
survey was dominated by brain imaging studies and only one other modality of motion track-
ing contained more than two studies allowing separate correlation analyses. We have com-
bined the rest of the studies into a category: other. The results show that a negative relationship
between sample size and reported accuracy was evident in different modalities, Fig 1D. The
correlation between log10 transformed sample size and reported accuracy was r(39) = −0.64,
p < 0.001, for brain imaging studies, r(3) = −0.61, p < 0.271 for motion tracking studies, and
r(7) = −0.90, p = 0.001 for other studies, suggesting that the negative relationship between sam-
ple size and reported accuracy was independent of the study modality.

A strong relationship between sample size and reported performance suggests that ML
models are biased to produce overoptimistic results when a sample used to train them is small
Fig 1. In supervised learning, the ideal model would both approximate the regularities in the
training data, and would generalise to unseen new data. However, this is unlikely because
training data may include noise and may not represent the population sufficiently well. Too
complex models are likely to represent noise in the training data, rather than underlying pat-
terns of interest. Such models overfit the training data. In contrast, too simple models are likely
to underfit training data and fail to capture underlying regularities. Obviously, one would aim
to construct a model which fits training data just enough to capture a pattern which is repre-
sentative of the population, but does not fit the noise inherent in the available training data.
Underfitting is improved by simply applying models of increasing complexity, however, over-
fitting, is a more difficult problem. To assess and control overfitting, model validation is com-
monly used.

Validation strategies

A reliable way to validate a ML model’s performance is to train a model with available data
and assess its classification performance using newly collected data or a separate dataset.
Another reliable approach, commonly called Train/Test Split, is to separate a portion of data
before developing a ML model and to use that data only for validation, Fig 2A. Using unseen
data to test a ML model gives an unbiased estimate of what performance would be when the
model is deployed for actual predictions in real-world situations. However, these approaches
require one to collect or hold a substantial amount of data for validation, and are rarely used in
research involving human participants, where data collection is commonly associated with
high costs.

Cross-Validation is a common solution when the available datasets are limited. Instead of
training a fixed model only once as in Train/Test split, iteratively several models are developed
on different portions of the data. K-Fold is a common CV approach. First, a well-defined
model is developed by normalising data, selecting features, tuning parameters and/or

performing other development steps. Then a portion of data is separated for validation leaving
the rest to train a model and predict the classes on the left-out validation data. This process is
repeated several times, by leaving out a different portion of the data for validation until all the
data is used. The model’s performance is then calculated as a mean of classification perfor-
mances, in each of the validation folds, Fig 2B.

When validation with a separate dataset is not feasible because of small sample size, K-Fold
CV is very economical as it allows one to use all the data for training and also to reuse all of it
for validation. If validation was to be performed with a separate dataset, double the amount of
data would be needed to have the same quantity of data for training and validation. More
importantly CV theoretically should give more accurate out of sample error estimation, com-
pared to previously discussed approaches. Using all of the available data for validation should

Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size

give out of sample error estimates which are less influenced by noise and are more representa-
tive of the population, compared to using a portion of the data as with Train/Test Split or new
dataset.

However, K-Fold CV does not ensure that the data used to validate the classifier is not part

of the data used to train it. Stone [10] pointed out the importance of separating CV used for
model development and CV used for model evaluation. Varma and Simon [7] have demon-
strated that using the data to validate a model which was also used to develop it can produce
overoptimistic performance estimates.

One possible solution which avoids pooling training and validation data, but at the same

time is economical (allows all the data to be used for training and reuse for validation) is
Nested CV [7, 11], Fig 2C. A portion of data is split at the beginning and in each CV fold
a model is then developed on the reduced training set from scratch, including feature selec-
tion and parameter tuning. This is repeated with splitting a different portion of the data for
validation, and each time developing a new model for training until all the data is used.
Varma and Simon [7] suggest that Nested CV provides almost unbiased performance
estimates.

Methods

In this study, by using Gaussian noise as data, we have simulated a situation in which robust
validation should produce two-class classification accuracy approaching theoretical chance
level of 50%. We tested five validation approaches: Train/Test Split, K-fold, Nested, and two
types of partially nested CV. Importantly, we performed these simulations using different sam-
ple sizes to provide an insight into whether the tendency to report higher performance esti-
mates with smaller sample size could be due to insufficiently reliable validation. In addition,
we have tested what other factors, apart from sample size, influence overfitting and how differ-
ent validation methods perform with discriminable data. To show that simulation results gen-
eralise to algorithms differing in complexity, two algorithms were used. One, computationally
demanding and complex, where Support Vector Machine (SVM) [12] classifier with Radial
Basis Function (RBF) kernel was coupled with Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature
Elimination (SVM-RFE) [13] feature selection. Another, simpler, where the logistic regression
classifier was coupled with two-sample t-test feature selection.

Overview of procedures

Typically, ML algorithm development starts with data cleaning and outlier removal, then the
data is normalised to ensure that separate features have a balanced influence on the labels.
Then if number of features is large, which is especially true for neuroimaging and gene expres-
sion studies [3, 14, 15], feature selection is performed. This is done because ML algorithms
tend to achieve optimal performance in a reduced feature space [6, 16]. Many of the ML mod-
els include hyper-parameters which can be fine-tuned. This process is commonly coupled with
CV to not only achieve optimal algorithm performance, but also to control overfitting. Finally,
the model is validated to ensure that it generalises to “unseen” data. Below the development
stages of ML algorithms which were used in this study are described with a particular emphasis
on validation.

Data

Data was simulated by randomly drawing values from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of
zero and standard deviation (SD) of one. Numpy (Python) method random.normal was used
to generate pseudo-random values drawn from standard normal distribution. Binomial

Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size

classification was used, and each simulated dataset was split into two equally sized subsets for
each class. Because features did not bear meaningful relationship to labels, and classes were
balanced, binomial classification models would be expected to yield chance level classification
accuracy of 50%.

Data normalisation, cleaning

As the data was drawn from standard normal distribution data normalisation was not neces-
sary and was omitted. Data cleaning was also not necessary in this case; however, with real
datasets, missing value replacement/removal and outlier replacement/removal are usually nec-
essary steps.

Classification algorithms

For classification, SVM [12] was chosen because it was by far most commonly used algorithm
in our survey, Fig 1B. We have also used a logistic regression algorithm.

SVM separates the classes by maximising the gap between training examples from each
class. The examples in the test data are when assigned a label based on which side of the gap
they fall. The SVM algorithm assumes linear separability of classes, however in reality this
assumption in rarely realistic. Therefore, a regularisation parameter C is introduced which
weighs the importance of misclassification and allows SVM to fit a linear separating hyper-
plane with some of the examples being misclassified. Another method to deal with non-line-
arly separable classes is to use kernel functions. Kernel functions project features to a higher
dimensional space. This enables the separation of classes which are non-linearly separable in
the original space with a linear hyperplane in a higher dimensional space. In this study SVM
with RBF kernel was used. RBF kernel has a regularisation parameter γ, which regulates the
spread of the kernel function and in turn determines the flexibility of the separating hyper-
plane. SVM was implemented with Libsvm library [17].

A logistic regression model was also used as a classifier. It uses logistic function to predict
binary classes based on linear combinations between class and features. Logistic regression
was implemented using Scikit-learn library [18].

Parameter tuning of classification algorithms

SVM-RBF regularization parameters C and γ were optimized to improve classification and to
control overfitting. Both parameters regulate the complexity of a separating hyperplane. By set-
ting a low penalty for misclassification (parameter C) SVM tries to classify all training exam-
ples correctly making a separating boundary complex. Similarly, the higher the value of
kernel’s γ parameter, the more flexible and complex the separating boundary. To optimise C
and γ parameters we used a grid search approach, which evaluates classification accuracy with
different combinations of C and γ parameters by using 10-fold CV. A pairing of C and γ
parameters which gave the highest CV accuracy was selected. Grid search was performed with
parameters set to: C = 2j, where j = 1, 2, . . . 7 and γ = 2i, where i = -1, -2, . . . -7. Grid search
was implemented with Scikit-learn library. For visualisation of how parameters influence SVM
decision boundary see Devos et al. [19]

To control for overfitting logistic regression was regularised using L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge)

penalty terms and the magnitude of penalty was controlled by regularization parameter C.
Like in SVM, smaller values of C specify stronger regularization. To optimize parameters grid
search was performed with penalty set to L1 or L2 and C set to C = ei, where i = 0, 1, . . . 9.

Feature selection

Most of the studies in our own and other surveys [3, 4] used feature selection. Therefore, for
our simulations we initially generated 50 features comprised of Gaussian noise and used fea-
ture selection to reduce dimensionality. We chose two feature selection methods, one compu-
tationally complex—SVM-RFE, and another simpler—two-sample t-test.

SVM-RFE algorithm selects features based on how important they are for an SVM classifier
to separate classes. SVM-RFE starts with a full feature set and in a number of iterations elimi-
nates a set number of features which are deemed least important for separating classes by an
SVM algorithm, using weight vector of dimension length(s) as a ranking criterion [13]. The
algorithm removes least important features in iterations because in each iteration the relation-
ship between features and labels changes. Top-ranked features are not necessarily the most rel-
evant individually; they are, however, optimized by considering interdependencies with other
features and the class. The final feature set is selected from the iteration in which SVM achieves
best classification performance. In this study a single feature was eliminated in each SVM-RFE
iteration and the final feature set was selected based on the highest classification accuracy by
linear SVM with C set to 1.

Two-sample t-test was also used for feature selection. In contrast to SVM-RFE it is a much
simpler method which ranks features based on how different feature means are between the
two classes. In this study, 10 features with the highest absolute value of t statistic were selected.

Validation and performance evaluation

For validation of the results, five different validation approaches were used and their perfor-
mance was compared.

Train/Test Split is a simple and reliable validation approach. A portion of the data was split

before any model development steps and it was used only once to validate the developed
model Fig 2A.

K-Fold CV. First, a single well-defined model was developed by selecting features and tun-
ing parameters, Fig 2B. Then the model was validated by separating one-tenth of the data for
validation and the rest for training. CV process was iteratively repeated ten times. In each fold,
a different one-tenth of the data was selected for validation. In such way, in the end, all the
data was used for training and also for validation. The final performance of the model was
then calculated as a mean of classification performances in each of the ten validation folds.

Nested CV is performed in two layers to achieve training and validation separation, Fig 2C.

In this study, ten-fold Nested CV was used. In the outer layer, 10% of the data was separated
for validation and the rest of the data was used to develop a model. In the internal layer, the
remaining 90% of the data was used for feature selection and parameter tuning. A developed
model was then validated with 10% of the data which was split at the beginning. This process
was repeated 10 times by selecting a different 10% of the data for validation and by using a dif-
ferent 90% of the data to develop a new model from scratch. The overall performance was then
calculated as a mean of classification performances of the 10 separately developed models on
different 10% sets of the validation data which was not involved in developing the models.
Partially nested validation. Arbabshirani et al [3] in their large survey noted that in most
studies, feature selection was performed in a non-nested fashion. Feature extraction/selection
can be computationally very demanding which could explain why it is frequently performed
only once on pooled training and testing data, instead of performing it in each CV fold. In this
study, to examine whether accuracy estimates are biased more by feature selection or parame-
ter tuning we performed two types of partially nested validation, Fig 2D. First, feature selection
was performed in a non-nested fashion and parameter tuning in nested fashion. That is,

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224365 November 7, 2019

Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size

feature selection was performed once in an outer nested validation loop, on pooled training
and validation data. Only parameter tuning was nested and performed 10 times, avoiding the
pooling of training and validation data. Second, feature selection was performed in nested and
parameter tuning in a non-nested fashion.

Implementation

The results section is organised as follows. First, we compare five different validation methods
using Gaussian noise data as features. Data was split into two equally sized subsets for each
class. The feature set started with 50 features and was reduced by using feature selection. Sam-
ple size was manipulated, and classification results were evaluated using Train/Test Split, K-
fold CV, Nested CV and two types of partially nested CV. The performance estimate was accu-
racy. To obtain accuracy distributions models were trained 50 times at each sample point, then
validation results were compared against theoretical chance level using confidence level of
95%.

Then, other factors apart from sample size which can lead to overfitting with K-fold CV
were investigated. We kept sample size constant, but manipulated number of Gaussian noise
features. As feature-to-sample ratio is well known to influence classification result reliability
[20–22], we additionally manipulated feature-to-sample ratio from 1/3 to 3 and show that fea-
ture/sample size ratio can be a good indicator of how much a model is likely to overfit. We also
investigated how overfitting was influenced by grid size used to fine-tune classifier hyper-
parameters and number of CV folds.

Finally, different validation methods were compared by using discriminable data to investi-

gate an interaction between the increase in classification ability [23–25] and the reduction in
overfitting with larger samples. Discriminable datasets were generated with 50 features and
balanced labels. 40 of the features were generated from zero-mean and one SD Gaussian noise
for both classes. To create discriminability, the remaining 10 features for the first class were
generated from Gaussian noise with a mean of 0.5 and SD of one while for the second class
from the Gaussian noise with a mean of 0 and SD of one.

Unless indicated differently all model parameters were set as described in this section.

Results
Comparison of different validation methods

The effect of sample size on how close the empirical classification result is to theoretical chance
level was examined. The sample size was manipulated and ranged from 20 to 1000. To evaluate
classification results K-Fold, Nested, Train/Test Split and two types of partially nested valida-
tion were used. Fig 3 shows that by using both a complex algorithm, where SVM-RFE feature
selection was coupled with a SVM-RBF classifier (SVM algorithm hereafter, Fig 3A), and a
simpler algorithm, with t-test feature selection and a logistic regression classifier (logistic
regression algorithm hereafter, Fig 3B), accuracies given by K-Fold CV were considerably
higher than the theoretical chance level of 50%. The highest difference was observed with
smaller sample sizes; however, the difference was still evident even at the sample size of
N = 1000. In contrast accuracy distributions produced by using Nested CV and Train/Test
Split did not statistically significantly differ from 50% chance level with SVM and logistic
regression algorithms at 96.5% sample size points (p ranged from 4.3 × 10−4 to 0.997, a small
number of significant differences is expected by chance with 95% confidence level).

Two types of partially nested validation were also performed. In the first instance, only
parameter tuning was nested while feature selection was performed on the pooled training and
testing data in non-nested fashion. Fig 3 shows that nesting parameter tuning only was not

sufficient to control overfitting. By using both SVM and logistic regression algorithms, empiri-
cal accuracies at each sample point were significantly higher than the 50% chance level (p ran-
ged from 1.1 × 10−42 to 6.3 × 10−20 and from 1.7 × 10−33 to 1.7 × 10−22 respectively). The
results were considerably different when feature selection was nested and only parameter tun-
ing was performed on the pooled training and testing data. The curves approached 50% chance
level, Fig 3. One sample t-tests showed that for the SVM algorithm empirical accuracy distribu-
tions were significantly higher than 50% chance level on 56% sample size points (p ranged
from 2.8 × 10−5 to 0.879). For a logistic regression algorithm accuracy distribution using this
type of partially nested validation was higher than the chance level only at one sample size
point (2%, p ranged from 0.039 to 1.0).

Taken together, partially nested validation results show that to perform feature selection in
nested fashion is paramount for controlling overfitting, while nesting parameter tuning has a
smaller effect. This was the case for our data and models used. However, for other situations,
especially, if feature selection is not used or relied less, parameter tuning could contribute to
overfitting more. Our models relied on feature selection substantially, reducing feature num-
ber from 50 to 10, to represent ML studies for disorder prediction, which commonly use fea-
ture selection as an important model development step [3, 26].

Other factors apart from sample size influencing overfitting

Other factors influencing overfitting with K-Fold CV were examined. Sample size was kept
constant at N = 100 while feature number, parameter tuning grid size and number of CV folds
were manipulated. Both SVM-RFE and t-test feature selection were used in combination with
SVM-RBF classifier (Fig 4) and logistic regression classifier (Fig 5).

Number of features. For both SVM (Fig 4A) and logistic regression (Fig 5A) classifiers
feature number had a clear influence on overfitting. The higher the number of features used,
the greater the difference was between the empirical classification accuracy and theoretical
chance level of 50%. There was also a clear difference between the feature selectors used.
SVM-RFE accuracies were higher than t-test, and this difference became greater with increas-
ing feature space to select from.

Classifier hyper-parameter optimisation. Grid size used to fine-tune SVM-RBF C and γ
parameters also had a clear influence on overfitting, as grid size increased, achieved accuracies
also increased (Fig 4B). There was, however, no such effect on accuracy when the grid size to
fine-tune logistic regression parameters was increased (Fig 5B).

Number of CV folds. Similar results were observed when the number of CV folds used to
fine-tune the model’s hyper-parameters was increased. With SVM-RBF classifier, the use of a
higher number of folds affected accuracy up to approximately 20 folds when the effect levelled
off. There was again no clear effect when the number of CV folds was increased with the logis-
tic regression classifier.

Feature-to-sample ratio

The results on other factors influencing overfitting showed that the number of features used to
develop a model had a clear impact on overfitting regardless of the feature selector or classifier
used. This effect was investigated further as it is likely that feature-to-sample ratio could be a
better indicator of how much a model is likely to overfit compared to sample size alone. Sam-
ple size was manipulated from 42 to 446 and feature number was also manipulated accord-
ingly, to achieve different feature-to-sample ratios of 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 10 and 20, Fig 6. The

results showed that feature-to-sample ratio is a good indicator of how much a model is likely
overfit. By using both SVM (Fig 6A) and logistic regression (Fig 6B) algorithms the accuracies
achieved by models with higher feature-to-sample ratios were greater.

Validation with discriminable data

To make data discriminable, 10 out of 50 features were generated from Gaussian noise with
means differing between classes (see section Implementation). SVM-RFE was used for feature
selection and SVM-RBF for classification. Models were validated using different validation
methods: K-Fold CV, Nested CV and Train/Test Split. Fig 7A shows that performance esti-
mates were varied. There were no significant differences in accuracy between Train/Test Split
validation and Nested CV at 96% of sample size points, two-sample t-test (p ranged from 0.039
to 0.995). K-fold CV however gave significantly higher performance estimates compared to
Nested CV (p ranged from 1.3 × 10−6 to 5.4 × 10−35) or Train/Test Split validation (p ranged
from 3.8 × 10−1 to 5.3 × 10−19). The accuracy for both Train/Test split and Nested CV
increased with sample size and then levelled off when sample size reached approximately
N = 700 at � 77% accuracy level. This shows a well-known aspect of ML models; with a larger
training sample size, models have higher statistical power to learn a pattern discriminating
between classes and achieve higher performance. Several studies have explored this by calculat-
ing learning curves which show accuracy as a function of the training sample size [23–25] and
assume a typical shape similar to Nested CV or Train/Test Split curves in Fig 7A. The K-fold
CV curve, on the other hand, was not of the typical learning curve shape. Although an increase
in learning must have been present with larger sample sizes, the overfitting had a stronger
effect. This was further shown by exploring variability of performance estimates expressed as
95% confidence intervals, Fig 7B. Similarly, as in [4, 5] we found that with larger sample sizes
variability in performance estimates decreased. This was not the case for K-fold validation
where variability increased up to N � 60 and then started decreasing, Fig 7B inset. This
was caused by a high frequency of perfect classification (100%) occurrences at sample sizes
below 60.

Illustrative examples of why models overfit

Our simulations show that validating models with the data which was also involved in model
training can lead to overfitting and overoptimistic performance estimates. However, it may
not necessarily be intuitive why overfitting occurs. Here we graphically illustrate how two
model development stages, parameter tuning and feature selection, can lead to overfitting if
those development stages are performed on the pooled training and validation data. The exam-
ples are small and simple, illustrating the concepts explored in our main simulations in a more
intuitive way.

Parameter tuning and overfitting

To illustrate how parameter tuning can lead to overfitting we have used a small classification
example with a sample size of 10 (5 samples from one class and 5 samples from a second class)
and only two features. The data was generated from random Gaussian noise and SVM-RBF
(with the same settings as in the main analyses) was used to separate data points from two clas-
ses (shown in red and blue in Fig 8A).

We have developed two models in parallel on the same data and with the identical settings.

To validate we have used the same two data points for both models. The only difference
between the models was that the first model (Fig 8A left) was trained on all 10 data points—on
the pooled training and validation data. The second model (Fig 8A right) was developed by
keeping training and validation data independent. It was trained on 8 data points making the
remaining 2 validation data points ‘’invisible’’ to the model. Decision boundaries (lines sepa-
rating blue and red areas in Fig 8A) were clearly differently learned by the two models. The
first model fitted the data which was used for validation and classified two validation data
points correctly, while the second model, for which validation data was ‘invisible’ misclassified
the same two validation data points.

By running these two models 1000 times, each time with different randomly generated
data, both models were capable of fitting training data and achieve over 80% classification
accuracy, showing that the models were capable of fitting random noise well. The first model,

however, also fitted noise in the validation data achieving mean accuracy of 81%, while the sec-
ond model for which validation points were ‘invisible’ achieved accuracy rate of 50%, random
guessing level.

Overall, this example graphically illustrates that complex enough models are capable of fit-
ting random noise in the data. It also shows that if the data, which is used for validation, is also
involved in parameter tuning, the performance is inflated because the models fit the noise not
only in training but also in validation data.

Feature selection and overfitting

To graphically illustrate how performing feature selection on pooled training and validation
data can lead to overfitting we have used t-test feature selection. t statistic of two-sample t-test
simply shows how different are the means between two classes in units of standard error. We
have used Gaussian noise data of 50 samples equally balanced between two classes and per-
formed t-test feature selection to select 10 features from sets varying from 20 to 100 features.

20% of the data was randomly split for validation and once again we have performed feature

selection using two different approaches. in the first instance it was performed on the pooled
training and validation data and in the second instance only training data was used for feature
selection. This was repeated 100 times.

Fig 8B shows that with the larger pool of features to select from, the selected ten features
had greater between-class mean differences than with the smaller pool of features to select
from (train lines in Fig 8B). This was the case for both approaches. The main difference
between two approaches was in validation. Selecting 10 features with greatest mean differences
on pooled training and validation data (100% of data) also led to greater between-class mean
differences in validation data alone (randomly split 20% of data). The effect also increased with
larger feature pool to select from. This was not the case when validation data was independent
of feature selection. Despite mean differences being high in ten selected features in the training
data (80% of data), the selected features produced low mean differences on validation data
(20% of randomly split data) which would be expected by chance.

Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size

This example shows that feature selection is capable to select features as discriminative
between classes because of inherent noise (in this example the data was Gaussian noise with
between class differences occurring by chance). It also shows that if feature selection is per-
formed on pooled training and validation data, the validation data can occur discriminative
because of noise.

Discussion

Robust evaluation of ML classification is imperative for ML research as it allows meaningful
comparisons between different studies and different methods. Robust evaluation is even more
important when available training and testing samples are small [1, 6].

Our results demonstrate the importance of separating training and testing data to avoid
optimistically biased performance estimates. K-Fold CV was not sufficient to control overfit-
ting. By simply testing the performance of the algorithm with the data which was also involved
in algorithm training was enough to produce biased results with small sample sizes. However,
a substantial bias still remained even with sample size of 1000. On the other hand, similar to
[7] we have found that Nested CV gave unbiased performance estimates. Furthermore, Nested
CV results were unbiased regardless of the sample size.

Additionally, we examined which model development stage, feature selection or parameter
tuning is implicated in validation bias more. Partially-nested validation results showed that by
performing only feature selection in a non-nested fashion gave considerably biased results,
while the bias was much smaller when only parameter tuning was performed in non-nested
fashion. In many studies, the initial number of measures (features) can be very large. In their
survey Arbabshirani et al. [3] noted that most of the neuroimaging studies consisted of two
parts. In the first part using statistical tests, such as t-tests, differences between groups were
identified. In the second part features, which were preselected in the first part, were used for
classification. As a result, feature selection was performed on the pooled training and testing
data and posed a bias. Although, performing feature selection multiple times in nested fashion
with high dimensional data can be computationally demanding, our simulations have shown
that it is necessary to avoid overfitting. Additionally, other model development stages which
were not examined in this study (e.g. normalisation, outlier removal) if performed on pooled
training and testing data could also lead to biased results.

We have also investigated other factors which could influence overfitting when K-Fold CV
is used. Our results have demonstrated that feature-to-sample ratio is a good indicator of how
much a model is likely to overfit. The accuracies achieved by models with higher feature-to-
sample ratios were greater. Increasing the set of parameters over which a model is optimized
also increased amount of bias with SVM model. There was no such effect with logistic regres-
sion. Similarly, greater number of CV folds used for parameter tuning had only a slight effect
with SVM model and no effect with logistic regression model.

Our simulations with discriminable data showed that by using Nested CV and Train/Test

split validation, models were capable of learning a pattern in the data more efficiently and
achieved higher performance with larger sample sizes. This is consistent with previous studies
which investigated accuracy as a function of the training sample size [23–25]. Interestingly, the
distance between K-fold and Nested CV curves with non-discriminable data (Fig 3A) was
larger than with discriminable data (Fig 7A) at each sample size point. This suggests that with
more discriminable data bias produced by less robust validation is lower and also the opposite,
the less discriminable the data the higher the importance of robust validation.

Validation results were highly variable as can be seen from 95% confidence intervals

included in each graph. The same algorithm used on the data drawn from the same

Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size

distribution produced broad range of performance estimates. The variability of performance
estimates was also greater with smaller sample sizes, Fig 7B. In most studies in our survey, a
single performance estimate was reported. However, as our results indicate and as noted by
Varoquaux [4] intrinsically large sampling noise signifies the importance of reporting confi-
dence intervals. Practically a distribution of performance measures could be produced by, for
example, multiple times differently/randomly splitting the data to CV folds [27].

Only a few previous studies systematically investigated ML validation caveats associated

with small sample size. Arbabshirani et al. [3] and Varoquaux [4] reviewed studies, which
applied ML methods for prediction of various brain disorders and found that studies with
smaller sample sizes tended to report higher classification performance. In this paper, as an
illustrative example we have performed a survey of studies which used ML classification to pre-
dict autism or absence of autism (two class problem) and indeed found a significant negative
relationship between sample size and accuracy, r(53) = −0.70, p < 0.001. Study surveys by
Arbabshirani et al. [3], Varoquaux [4] and our survey, all suggest the importance of robust
application of ML methods. To help in this process, there are good guideline studies advising
how to avoid pitfalls, including how to reliably validate the results [28, 29].

Like in our simulations Combrisson and Jerbi [5] used Gaussian noise data to investigate
how much empirical classification performance differed from theoretical chance level. Several
classifiers coupled with K-fold CV were used. Empirical accuracies overshot theoretical chance
level and were more variable when sample sizes were small. The researchers interpreted this
discrepancy between theoretical and empirical accuracy level as arising from the fact that small
samples give a bad approximation of true randomness. Our simulations, however, show that
this is not the case. In contrast to Combrisson and Jerbi [5] in our simulation we used not only
K-fold CV but also other validation methods. Nested and Train/Test Split validation results
showed no deviation from the theoretical chance level regardless of the sample size and the
effect of bad approximation of true randomness was not present. Overoptimistic performance
was observed only with validation methods in which the validation process pooled training
and testing data.

Varma and Simon [7] also used synthetic Gaussian noise data to investigate how far
experimental two-class classification error was from expected 50% theoretical error. The
researchers found that by using K-fold CV mean error was considerably overoptimistic. On
the other hand, Nested CV provided almost unbiased performance estimates. The research-
ers, however did not investigate the influence of sample size, which for all simulations was
fixed at N = 40. We show that not only with N = 40 but even at larger sample sizes of up to
N = 1000 K-fold CV bias remains, although it becomes less prominent with larger sample
sizes.

Combrisson and Jerbi [5] have shown that K-fold CV is more biased with small sample
size, while Varma and Simon [7] have shown that K-fold CV is biased, and Nested CV is not at
a fixed sample size. We have filled the gap by investigating both factors associated with bias,
namely validation method and sample size together. We have demonstrated that validation
methods which do not separate training and testing data at model development stage lead to
overoptimistic performance estimates. Moreover, the bias is strongest with small sample sizes.
This gives a good indication why in our own and other surveys [3, 4] there was a negative rela-
tionship between reported performance estimates and sample size.

Conclusion

We show that K-Fold CV provides optimistically biased performance estimates and is not suf-
ficient to control overfitting. Testing algorithm performance on the data which was used for

training the same algorithm is enough to produce strongly optimistically biased results when a
sample size is small. However, a substantial bias remains even with respectable sample sizes. In
contrast, Nested CV provides unbiased performance estimates. Completely separating testing
and training data is enough to obtain unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample
size. When only part of model development is performed in a nested fashion, nesting feature
selection is more important than parameter tuning to avoid overfitting. Other factors which
influence bias, such as data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space, number of CV folds and
data discriminability should also be considered.
