# Project Guidelines

## Python Environment

This project uses **uv** for Python package and environment management. Always use uv commands:

- `uv run <command>` - Run Python scripts/commands in the project environment
- `uv add <package>` - Add a package to the project
- `uv remove <package>` - Remove a package from the project
- `uv sync` - Sync the environment with the lock file
- `uv pip install <package>` - Install packages using uv's pip interface (if needed)

**NEVER** use `python`, `pip`, `python3`, or `pip3` directly. Always prefix commands with `uv`.

Examples:
- Instead of `python script.py`, use `uv run script.py`
- Instead of `pip install requests`, use `uv add requests`
- Instead of `pip install -r requirements.txt`, use `uv sync`

## Useful Commands Documentation

**IMPORTANT FOR ALL AIs:** When you discover or use helpful commands during your work:

1. **Add them to** `.useful_commands/useful_commands.txt` immediately
2. **Organize by category** (Training, Testing, Deployment, etc.)
3. **Include description** explaining what each command does
4. **Keep it current** - Update when commands change or become obsolete

This helps future AI sessions and human developers quickly find the right commands.

### Command Log Structure

## AI Settings - Cross-Project Knowledge Sharing

### Command Documentation Files

**Global Command Files** (`.useful_commands/`):
- `ml_training_commands.txt` - ML model training commands
- `backtest_commands.txt` - Backtesting commands
- `quick_reference.txt` - All commands quick reference

**Distributed Command Files** (`src/*/AI_COMMANDS.txt`):
Each `src/` subdirectory contains an `AI_COMMANDS.txt` file for module-specific commands.

### Instructions for All AI Assistants

When completing tasks:

1. **Document every working command** in appropriate files:
   - General commands → `.useful_commands/[category]_commands.txt`
   - Module-specific → `src/[module]/AI_COMMANDS.txt`

2. **Use this format**:
   ```
   ## Feature Name
   
   # Description
   command
   ```

3. **Check existing files** before creating duplicates

4. **Update AGENTS.md** if new command categories emerge
